        My embarrassing moment was when I was a grade 8 student and we were having a 
        report about a certain topic. I was so nervous at that time because our teacher 
        is very strict when it comes to reporting and she will get easily mad when there 
        is a simple mistake in the information. My groupmates were the ones starting the 
        report, and my topic is in the middle of the report, and they are explaining it well. 
        When my topic came up, I walked toward the middle of the classroom and was going to 
        start speaking, but I just got completely frozen and didn't say a word for a second. 
        My classmates and friends laughed, and luckily my teacher was in a good mood at that time, 
        so she laughed as well, and I laughed at myself. I did take a deep breath and start my report, 
        and I explained it well. Every now and then, when I am giving a report, I just take a deep 
        breath before I start talking so I don't get nervous anymore.
