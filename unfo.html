        My unforgettable moment was when I was 7 or 8 years old. We were at MOA and were having a little picnic,
        and then my uncle said that he was going to buy some food. I told him that I wanted to come with him to 
        buy food. It is a pretty long walk, but when we got to the store, he said that he would go to the bathroom,
        which is just near the store, but I was too focused on other things when he said that and I was not looking 
        at him. When I look back at him, he's not there anymore; I was looking everywhere and I can't really see 
        him. That's when I panicked, started crying, and dashed towards the picnic area. I luckily saw my other 
        uncle when I was running back, so I found them and started crying, and then my uncle, who I was with, 
        came back and started looking for me. It is unforgettable for me because it is the first time I felt so 
        much fear of getting lost, and there are so many people around that it is suffocating, but I learned my 
        lesson back then and never got lost again.
